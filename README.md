# Convex Optimization Applied to Superresolution

This project supplies matlab code to try to upscale an image using convex optimization. 
Two different algorithms were implemented and in the end compared:

* Default gradient descent
* Primal-Dual formulation

The Primal-Dual solving algorithm is largely based on
